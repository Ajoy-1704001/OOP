# Object Oriented Programming
Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm that can model real world scenarios using class and object. Class and Object are the two main buddies of Object Oriented Programming.

## Class:
Class can be think as a blueprint or building block. It consists of data members and some functions. Example: Human can be considered as a class which have attributes like name, age, hair color etc. and functionalities are walking, sleeping, eating etc. As said before, we can model anything around us using object oriented programing.

## Object:
If class is the defination of our model, then objects are the instance of the model. Objects are physical entity that contains data attribute and it's own functionality. Object needs class to follow the blueprint. When we create an instance of the object, it occupies some memory. Without creating object, class is useless. Example: We all are the objects of human class. Like I have my own name, age, hair color etc. and I can also perform several tasks.
