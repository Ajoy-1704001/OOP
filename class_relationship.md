# Class Relationship
Class relationship refers to relation between two or more classes. Relationships are needed to use the feature of one class to another or to create a special communication between classes. Like, there is a special relation between **Electronic** class and **TV** class. In object oriented programming, It supports four types of relationship such as Inheritance, Association, Aggregation and Composition. These relations are based on **Is-A*** relation, **Has-A** relation and **Part-of** relation. 

### Is-A Relation
When one class is a type of another class and can inherit the common attributes, that is know as **Is-A** relation. Example: **Iphone** is a **Mobile**. But we can't say, Mobile is a Iphone. Another example can be: Cow is an Animal. But "An animal is a cow" can't be possible since all animals are not cow. So, from this we can understand that **Is-A** relation is unidirectional. We can represent Is-A relaton simply by an unidirectional arrow.
